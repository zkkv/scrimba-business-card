			<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>Beyond crime-fighting, I find solace in the wonders of science and technology, staying abreast of advancements that could aid my superhero duties. Photography remains more than a profession â€” it&apos;s a way to preserve moments of humanity amidst the chaos. When not in action, I indulge in literature, movies, and the joy of helping others, reinforcing my commitment to making a positive impact on the world around me.</p>

			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>As your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, I balance a double life with a passion for protecting New York City from its darkest threats. By day, I navigate the challenges of being a student and freelance photographer at the Daily Bugle, capturing the city&apos;s essence through my lens. By night, I swing through the skyline, using my enhanced senses and agility to thwart crime and ensure the safety of its citizens.</p>
